# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)
# Student.create(first_name: "Mary", last_name: "Smith")
# Student.create(first_name: "John", last_name: "Wood")
# Student.create(first_name: "Michael", last_name: "Adams")
# SchoolClass.create(title: "Title 1", room_number: 1)
# SchoolClass.create(title: "Title 2", room_number: 4)
# SchoolClass.create(title: "Title 3", room_number: 15)
